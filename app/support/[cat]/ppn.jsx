            During pregnancy, your body essentially works for two. That’s why it’s crucial to correct any deficiencies before conception.
        Iron: Deficiency can lead to fatigue, weakness, and a weakened immune system.
Vitamin B12 and Vitamin D: Crucial for the nervous system and bone health.
Iodine: Supports thyroid function and brain development.
Calcium: Important for the baby's bone and teeth development.

            Advice: Get a blood test under your doctor’s guidance before pregnancy to identify deficiencies and create a personalized nutrition plan.

        <h2 className='text-2xl my-4'> Achieve a Healthy Weight</h2>

        Being underweight or overweight can increase certain risks during pregnancy. Reaching a healthy Body Mass Index (BMI) through proper nutrition and exercise is beneficial.

        🧘‍♀️ Gentle physical activities like walking, yoga, or pilates can help prepare your body for pregnancy and childbirth.

        <h2 className='text-2xl my-4'> Say Goodbye to Harmful Habits</h2>

        Once you begin planning for pregnancy, it’s important to leave behind certain habits:
        <ul className='list-disc list-inside'>
            <li>Smoking can decrease fertility and harm the baby's development.</li>
            <li>Alcohol consumption is strictly discouraged during pregnancy.</li>
            <li>Excessive caffeine should also be avoided — aim for less than 200 mg per day.</li>
        <li>
             Think of this time as a "cleansing phase" — one that will nourish both your body and your mind.
        </li>
        </ul>
