        Proper nutrition is vital for a baby's healthy growth and development. Nutritional needs change at each stage of life. Here is a month-by-month basic feeding guide:
      </SP>

      <SH2>0–6 Months: Exclusive Breastfeeding</SH2>
      <SP>
        The World Health Organization recommends exclusive breastfeeding for the first 6 months. Breast milk strengthens the immune system, is easy to digest, and is uniquely tailored for each baby.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        Formula should only be introduced if breast milk is insufficient or not available, and always with a doctor's recommendation.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        Newborns are usually fed every 2–3 hours.
      </SP>

      <SH2>6–12 Months: Transition to Solid Foods</SH2>
      <SP>
        From the 6th month, complementary foods along with breast milk (or formula) are recommended. The first solid foods to start with include: Vegetable purées (carrot, zucchini, potato), fruit purées (apple, pear, banana), yogurt, rice or corn-based baby cereals.
      </SP>

      <SH2>1–2 Years: Adjusting to the Family Table</SH2>
      <SP>
        By this stage, the baby can adapt to the family table. A balanced diet should include vegetables, fruits, grains, meat, and dairy products.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        Encouraging self-feeding is important for developing independence and motor skills.
      </SP>

      <SH2>2 Years and Beyond: Healthy Eating Habits</SH2>
      <SP>
        A balanced intake from all food groups is essential. Processed, sugary, and salty foods should be limited as much as possible. Drinking water regularly should become a habit. Appetite may vary; children should be guided toward healthy foods without pressure.
      </SP>

      <SH2>Things to Keep in Mind</SH2>
      <SP>
        Babies should not be given packaged fruit juices, sugary snacks, or salty foods. Each new food should be introduced one at a time to monitor for possible allergic reactions. Regular weight and height checks should be done, and any concerns about nutrition should be discussed with a doctor.
