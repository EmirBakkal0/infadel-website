        A newborn's sleep schedule is both a wonderful and challenging discovery for many parents. As babies adjust to the world, the concept of "sleep" gradually begins to take shape. You can use the information below as a guide to a healthier, more peaceful, and more balanced time during this period.
      </SP>

      <SH2>How Much Sleep to Expect?</SH2>
      <SP>
        Newborns can sleep a total of 14–17 hours a day. This sleep is usually interrupted by short bursts.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        Sleep schedules are not fixed; the distinction between day and night is not yet fully established.
      </SP>

      <SH2>Establishing a Sleep Schedule: Tips</SH2>

      <SH3>1. Bright Light During the Day, Dim Light at Night</SH3>
      <SP>
        Newborns don't yet understand the difference between day and night. You can support this rhythm by keeping the room light on during the day and providing a dimmer environment at night.
      </SP>

      <SH3>2. Short Sleep Windows</SH3>
      <SP>
        Babies are limited in the amount of time they can stay awake; they can usually stay awake for around 45–60 minutes. Exceeding this limit can cause insomnia or restlessness.
      </SP>

      <SH3>3. Preparing for Sleep</SH3>
      <SP>
        Establishing a regular sleep routine with activities such as feeding, bathing, calm conversation, and lullabies signals to your baby that it's "time to sleep."
      </SP>

      <SH3>4. Creating a Comfortable Sleep Environment</SH3>
      <SP>
        A comfortable room temperature (not too hot or too cold), a dark and quiet environment, and even white noise machines or soft sounds can all be supportive of sleep.
      </SP>

      <SH3>5. Swaddling</SH3>
      <SP>
        Swaddling in newborns can reduce sudden reflexes caused by external stimuli, promoting more restful sleep.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        However, swaddling should be discontinued once the baby is able to roll on the floor.
      </SP>

      <SH3>6. Sleep Safety</SH3>
      <SP>
        When putting your baby to sleep, always place them on their back; avoid soft bedding, pillows, loose blankets, and toys.
      </SP>
      <SP>
        Also, the baby should be in their own bed, not the parent's bed. Room-sharing (sleeping in the same room) is recommended for safety.
      </SP>

      <SH3>7. The Relationship Between Feeding and Sleep</SH3>
      <SP>
        Newborns need frequent feedings because their stomachs are small. Feeding them when they're awake can help them transition to sleep. Gentle interaction after a feeding, rather than putting them to sleep directly, helps establish a day-night distinction.
      </SP>

      <SH3>8. Let Them Wake Up Briefly</SH3>
      <SP>
        Even if your baby wakes up with a slight movement, sound, or rustle while sleeping, don't intervene immediately. Waiting for them to fall back asleep on their own can help your baby develop their own self-soothing skills.
      </SP>

      <SH2>Patience and Flexibility: The Most Essential Signs</SH2>
      <SP>
        Sleep patterns during the newborn period are complex and require patience. They may not be the same every day. Listen to your baby's rhythm and don't beat yourself up if things don't go your way. Over time, sleep patterns will develop, and you'll establish a more harmonious balance.
